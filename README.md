## The Problem

An estimated **$140 billion in crypto** is permanently lost every year because owners die without a succession plan. No wallet in the world has solved this cleanly. There is no on-chain way to say *"if I stop responding, send my assets to my family."*

DotWill solves this.

## What is DotWill?

DotWill is a decentralized inheritance protocol built with Solidity on Polkadot Hub. It uses a **heartbeat dead man's switch** — you check in regularly to prove you're alive. If you stop, the contract automatically unlocks and your beneficiaries can claim their share.

No lawyers. No banks. No middlemen. Just code.

## How It Works

```
Deploy Will → Set Beneficiaries → Fund Vault → Send Heartbeats
                                                      ↓
                                          Miss deadline + grace period
                                                      ↓
                                          Anyone calls trigger()
                                                      ↓
                                          Beneficiaries claim their share
```

1. **Deploy** — Owner deploys their personal `DotWill` contract via the factory. Sets beneficiaries with percentage shares (must total 100%).
2. **Fund** — Owner deposits PAS tokens into the vault.
3. **Heartbeat** — Owner sends a lightweight transaction every N days to reset the countdown.
4. **Trigger** — If the owner misses the interval + grace period, anyone can call `trigger()` to unlock the will.
5. **Claim** — Each beneficiary calls `claim(index)` to receive their share of the vault.
6. **Last Message** — Owner writes a final encrypted message. AES-256-GCM encrypted in the browser, stored on-chain, only readable after the will triggers.

## Features

### Smart Contracts
- **DotWillFactory** — Deploys individual `DotWill` contracts per user. One factory, unlimited wills.
- **DotWillV2** — Per-user inheritance contract with:
  - Heartbeat mechanism with configurable interval (1–365 days) and grace period
  - Multi-beneficiary support (up to 10) with basis-point share allocation
  - Native PAS token vault (deposit / withdraw)
  - On-chain encrypted last message storage
  - Emergency revoke with full refund
  - Custom Solidity errors for gas efficiency

### Frontend
- Full dashboard — live vault balance, countdown timer, heartbeat history
- 3-step will setup wizard — beneficiaries, heartbeat settings, deploy
- AI-powered Last Message writer (Gemini API)
- AES-256-GCM message encryption in the browser
- MetaMask integration with auto network switching to Polkadot Hub TestNet
- Fully responsive — desktop, tablet, mobile
- Polkadot official brand colors and Unbounded typeface

### AI Integration
- **AI Last Message** — Write rough notes, AI polishes them into a heartfelt final message for your beneficiaries
- Powered by Google Gemini API

## Smart Contract Architecture

### DotWillFactory
```solidity
function createWill(
    address payable[] memory _beneficiaryWallets,
    uint256[]          memory _shareBps,        // basis points, must sum to 10000
    string[]           memory _labels,
    uint256 _heartbeatInterval,                 // seconds (1 day – 365 days)
    uint256 _gracePeriod                        // seconds (1 day – 30 days)
) external payable returns (address)

function getWill(address user) external view returns (address)
function hasWill(address user) external view returns (bool)
```

### DotWillV2 (core functions)
```solidity
function heartbeat() external                          // Owner proves alive
function trigger() external                            // Anyone calls after deadline
function claim(uint256 index) external                 // Beneficiary claims share
function deposit() external payable                    // Add PAS to vault
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external             // Owner withdraws
function setEncryptedMessage(string calldata) external // Store last message
function getEncryptedMessage() external view           // Read after trigger only
function revoke() external                             // Owner cancels will
function status() external view returns (...)          // Full status snapshot
```
